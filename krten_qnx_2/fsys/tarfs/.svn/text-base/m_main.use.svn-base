The TARFS .tar helper (mount_tarfs)

%C [options] source target
%C [options] -m source [source...]

where [options] are optional parameters chosen from:
    -v             verbose operation

This program can be used with the "mount" command (this is done
automatically by the mount command itself), or standalone.

Its job is to issue the mount command to the tar filesystem.

If used implicitly by the mount command, all you need to worry
about is the mount command itself:

    mount -T tarfs source.tar[.gz] [dirname]

This will mount the source tar file (which can be compressed) as
"dirname" (if "dirname" isn't specified, there are defaults, see
below).

If used standalone, the options are similar:

    mount_tarfs source.tar[.gz] [dirname]

The real advantage, though, of using this in standalone mode is
the ability to mount multiple tar filesystems with one command
line, for example:

    mount_tarfs -m *.tar.gz

This will mount all compressed tar files into their default mountpoints.

The extensions ".tar", ".tar.gz", and ".tgz" are all changed to ".dir"
(well... ".tar.gz" is actually changed to ".tar.dir").

Any filenames that don't have the above-listed extensions will have
".dir" ADDED to their names.
