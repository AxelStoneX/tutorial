The SIM-000 Driver

%C [options] arguments

where [options] are optional parameters chosen from:
    -c config      name of configuration file (default searches in
                   current directory for "adios.cfg" and then in
                   "/etc/adios.cfg")
    -n devicename  Name of the device to register (default "/dev/sim000-<port>")
    -p port        Hexadecimal base port of the device (default 0x2D0), can
                   be specified multiple times for multiple devices
    -v             verbose operation
    -0             default output value is 0 (default)
    -1             default output value is 1

This is a simulator driver.  It will manifest a name for the device in the
form /dev/sim000-<port>, where "<port>" is replaced with the four digit
lowercase hexadecimal base address of the SIM-000's control I/O port.
Note that the port number isn't really used for any hardware control with
the simulator, it's just there for uniquely identifying instances of the
simulator.  For example, specifying:

    sim000 -p370 -p380

indicates that there are two SIM-000 simulated "cards"; the first is installed
at "port" 370 and will be given the device name /dev/sim000-0370, and the second
is installed at "port" 380 and will be given the device name /dev/sim000-0380.

Note that this is a simulated device only, and doesn't require any hardware.

The interaction of the -n and -p options is such that the -p option captures
whatever -n option had been in effect and erases the -p option value.

For example:

    sim000 -p200 -n/dev/spud -p300 -p400 -n/dev/xyz -p500 -p600

Will create 5 devices (one for each -p option).  The devices will
be:

    Port    Device Name
    ----    -----------
    0x200   /dev/sim000-0200
    0x300   /dev/spud
    0x400   /dev/sim000-0400
    0x500   /dev/xyz
    0x600   /dev/sim000-0600

Generally, it is recommended to not use the -n option unless there is a
special requirement to do so.

If no -p is specified, then one device at port 0x2d0 is assumed.  If any
-p options are specified then ONLY THOSE DEVICES are assumed.  I.e.:

    sim000 -p300

assumes that there is exactly one device, and that it is at port 0x300.  On
the other hand:

    sim000

assumes that there is exactly one device as well, and that it is at port 0x2d0
(the default).

Generally, you'd run the sim000 program in the background:
