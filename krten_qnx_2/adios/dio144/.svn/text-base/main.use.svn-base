The DIO-144 Driver

%C [options] arguments

where [options] are optional parameters chosen from:
    -n devicename  Name of the device to register (default "/dev/dio144-<port>")
    -p port        Hexadecimal base port of the device (default 0x2C0), can
                   be specified multiple times for multiple devices
    -v             verbose operation
    -0             initialize outputs to "0" by default (default)
    -1             initialize outputs to "1" by default

This is the device driver for the DIO-144 board.  It will manifest a
name for the device in the form /dev/dio144-<port>, where "<port>"
is replaced with the four digit lowercase hexadecimal base address of
the DIO-144 control I/O port.  For example, specifying:

    dio144 -p360 -p380

indicates that there are two DIO-144 cards; the first is installed at ports
360 through 377 (hex) and will be given the device name /dev/dio144-0360,
and the second is installed at ports 380 through 397 and will be given the
device name /dev/dio144-0380 (the DIO-144 card occupies 24 consecutive
locations in I/O space).

Note that the DIO-144 device is a 16-bit ISA card.

The interaction of the -n and -p options is such that the -p option captures
whatever -n option had been in effect and erases the -p option value.

For example:

    dio144 -p200 -n/dev/spud -p300 -p400 -n/dev/xyz -p500 -p600

Will create 5 devices (one for each -p option).  The devices will
be:

    Port    Device Name
    ----    -----------
    0x200   /dev/dio144-0200
    0x300   /dev/spud
    0x400   /dev/dio144-0400
    0x500   /dev/xyz
    0x600   /dev/dio144-0600

Generally, it is recommended to not use the -n option unless there is a
special requirement to do so.

If no -p is specified, then one device at port 0x2c0 is assumed.  If any
-p options are specified then ONLY THOSE DEVICES are assumed.  I.e.:

    dio144 -p300

assumes that there is exactly one device, and that it is at port 0x300.  On
the other hand:

    dio144

assumes that there is exactly one device as well, and that it is at port 0x2c0
(the default).

Generally, you'd run the dio144 program in the background:

    dio144 &

BEWARE! The switch settings look backwards on the card -- 0 is "ON" and 1 is
"OFF" for the address selections :-)
