The Webcounter Utility Phase III

%C [options] arguments

where [options] are optional parameters chosen from:
    -b rrggbb      Background colour, hex red/green/blue (default 000000)
    -d ndigits     Number of digits (default 6)
    -f rrggbb      Foreground colour, hex red/green/blue (default ff0000)
    -n devicename  Name of directory to register (default "/dev/webcounters")
    -N numctrs     Number of counters to support (default 100)
    -r renderstyle Select the render style (default "7seg", see below)
    -s startcount  Starting count for ALL counters (default 0)
    -S startfile   Fetch (and save) start count as 4 byte native-endian value
                   from/to file <startfile>. (no default, assume -s0)
    -x xsize       Size of generated graphic (x axis) (default <ndigits>*10)
    -y ysize       Size of generated graphic (y axis) (default 20)
    -v             verbose operation

This is the Webcounter Utility Phase III.

It has the same basic functionality as the Phase II version, but includes
the following enhancements:

Support for multiple counters, the -n parameter is now interpreted as a
directory name, and -N controls how many counters are implemented.
The startfiles are not compatible with phase I or II.

Original functionality of Phase II
----------------------------------
Ability to select the rendering function (use the -r, and give it either
"7seg" or "8x8" -- you can easily add more).

Added ability to have .txt extensions where you can get the ASCII value
of the counter.

Added ability to write to the .txt (or .gif) file to set an ASCII value.

Original functionality of Phase I
---------------------------------

Simply running it will create a file that can be incorporated into a webpage.
When read, the counter will increment by one.

If a "-S startfile" is specified, and it exists, the initial value of the
counter will be read from the startfile file.  If it does not exist, then
the initial value is assumed to be zero.  Whenever the counter is incremented,
the value in the startfile is incremented as well.
If "-s startcount" is used, then the start value is set to startcount.
"-s" overrides "-S" and can therefore be used to seed the startfile with a
given count:

    webcounter -s3000 -S /etc/myvalue.dat

Starts the webcounter with an initial value of 3000, ignores the value in
/etc/myvalue.dat, but updates it whenever the counter is incremented.

For simplicity, the initial "font" is a simple 7-segment LED-style display.
Since we're simulating an LED, we use the traditional red colouring in the
foreground colour.
